# donot
> A Javascript utility library that you shouldn't use

This is basically my collection of functions that i often use in projects. They can probably be found in other libraries (like Lodash), but i don't want to use those libraries (because they're big) or because it's overkill.

Because this is a bit of a grabbag of things you probably shouldn't be using this library.

## Install
Using `npm`:
```
$ npm install --save donot
```

Using `yarn`:
```
$ yarn add donot
```

`donot` can be used as a CommonJS module, AMD (with Require.js) or as a plain old Javacript global.
